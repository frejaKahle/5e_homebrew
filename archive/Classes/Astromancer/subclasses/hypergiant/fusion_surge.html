<i>6th level Hypergiant object feature</i>
<p>When you cast an evocation spell of 3rd level or higher that deals damage, you may expend an additional spell slot of the same level to cause the spell to be cast as if cast using a spell slot of one level higher. Targets damaged by a spell cast with
    this that have resistance to the damage type of the spell take an addition amount of damage equal to your level in this class (not halved from resistance).<br><br>Ex: You, a 6th level astromancer, expend two 3rd level spell slots as part of one action
    to cast Fireball as a 4th level spell, rolling 32 for damage, a creature that is resistant to fire damage fails its saving throw and takes 16 fire damage from the fireball and an additional 6 damage from your level in this class.</p>
