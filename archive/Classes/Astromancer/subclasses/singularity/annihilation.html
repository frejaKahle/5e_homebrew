<i>20th level Singularity object feature</i>
<p>At 20th level, you gain the ability to annihilate matter. Once per long rest you may use an action to choose an object that weighs no more than 10 pounds or creature you can see within 80 feet. Choosing an object causes the object to instantly dissapear,
    choosing a creature causes it to 8d10 force damage. At any point before your next turn you may cause an explosion to take place where the target was when you used this action. If you do not cause the explosion before your next turn, you regain the
    highest level spell slot that you are missing 8th level and below.<br><br> The explosion caused by this ability has a radius of 30 feet and spreads through walls and corners. All falammable objects not being worn or carried within the radius are incenerated
    into ash and the explosion melts up to 2 feet of stone or 3 inches of metal. Anything caught in the blast must make a constitution saving throw against your spell save DC or take 8d4 force damage, 6d6 radiant damage, and 4d8 fire damage, taking half
    damage on a successful save.
