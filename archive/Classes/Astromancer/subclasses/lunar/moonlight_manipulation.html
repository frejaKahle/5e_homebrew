<i>6th level Lunar object feature</i>
<p>
    You always know and can determine the phase of any lunar objects.
    <br><br> Additionally, when a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you may use your reaction to roll a d8 and reduce the damage taken by the roll plus your proficiency bonus. The attacker then takes radiant damage equal to twice
    the roll of the d8.
    <br> You can use this reaction twice per long rest.
