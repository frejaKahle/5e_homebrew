<i>6th level Lunar object feature</i>
<p>
    You always know and can determine the phase of any lunar objects.<br><br> Additionally, when you take damage, you may use your reaction to roll a d6 and reduce the damage taken by the roll. The attacker then takes radiant damage equal to the roll
    of the d6. You may also add any stored dice from your Spell Cycle feature and add them to the roll of the d6.<br> You can use this reaction a number of times per long rest equal to your proficiency bonus.
