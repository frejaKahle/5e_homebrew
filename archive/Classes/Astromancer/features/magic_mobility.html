<i>5th and 9th level astromancer feature</i>
<p>
    Starting at 5th level, you gain the ability to move when you cast spells.
    <br>You can walk up to five times the spell's level in feet as part of the Cast a Spell action if the spell you cast is an astromancer spell of first level or higher.
    <br><br>At 9th level, your walking speed increases by 10 feet if you are holding an astromancer spellcasting focus. And, you can use a bonus action to end a concentration spell of 3rd level or higher early to gain the effects of two of the Dodge,
    Disengage, and Dash actions of your choice until the end of your current turn.
