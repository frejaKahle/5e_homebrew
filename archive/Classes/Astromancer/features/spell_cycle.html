<i>13th and 17th level Astromancer feature</i>
<p>
    At 13th level you gain the ability to recyle some of the energy from the cantrips you cast. You recieve the following abilities:
    <ul>
        <li>When you reduce a creature to 0 hit points with an astromancer cantrip, roll a d20. On a roll of 8 through 15, you regain a 1st level spell slot. On roll of 16 through 20, you regain a spell slot of 2nd level.</li>
        <li>When you use your Magic Mobility feature to move as you cast a spell, you can instead choose to teleport instead of walk the amount of feet granted by the feature.</li>
    </ul>
    At 17th level your ability to recycle the magical energy of your spells increases. You then gain the following abilities:
    <ul>
        <li>When you cast an astromancer cantrip on your turn for which you roll an attack roll against a single target, you may take a -5 penalty to the attack roll of the cantrip to target two seperate targets.</li>
        <li>If you have more than 25 hit points, you can use the Cast a Spell action after the end of another creature's turn, with the limit that you can only cast a cantrip or spell of 5th level and below, or you can use a reaction provided you have already
            used your reaction on a particular round of combat.
            <br>Doing so reduces you to one hit point, your hit point maximum is reduced by 25, and your level of Exhaustion is raised to 3. If you already have 3 levels of Exhaustion, you instead gain only 1 level of exhaustion.</li>
    </ul>
    <br><br>You can use any of the above abilities a total number of times equal to your proficiency bonus.
