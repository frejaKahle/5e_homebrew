<i>20th level Hypergiant object feature</i>
<p>Starting at 20th level, you may use a bonus action to move any piece of metal within 90 feet of you that weighs no more than 1000 pounds up to 60 feet in any direction. Moving a creature that is composed of metal of wearing some requires that creature
    to use a reaction to make a strength saving throw against your spell save DC or be pulled along by the metal, staying stationary on a success. <br>You may choose to cause a target to slam into a surface or a creature as part of this bonus action by
    moving your target at least 20 feet in a straight line toward the surface or creature. <br>

        <li>If slamming a creature into an object, the creature takes 4d4 bludgeoning damage and 2d4 lightning damage.</li>
        <li>If slamming an object into a creature, make a spell attack roll with your spellcasting ability against the creature. On a hit the creature takes 4d4 bludgeoning damage and 2d4 lightning damage.</li>
        <li>If slamming a creature into another creature, make a spell attack roll against the stationary creature with your spellcasting ability. On a hit, both creatures take 2d4 bludgeoning damage and 1d4 lightning damage. On a miss, the moving creature
            takes 4d4 bludgeoning damage and 2d4 lightning damage. </li>
