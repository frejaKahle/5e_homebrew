    <br><br><b><i>Create Current</i> (1 charge):</b> As a bonus action on your turn you choose a creature within 100 feet of you that you can see and is in water or as a reaction to a creature falling into water you target the creature that has fallen
    into water, you cause the target to be pushed with great force. The target must make a strength saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 force damage and moving 150 feet in a direction you choose on a failed save. On a successful save,
