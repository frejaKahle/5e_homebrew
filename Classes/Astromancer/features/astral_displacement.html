<i>11th and 15th level Astromancer feature</i>
<p>
    At 11th level, you gain the ability to move the source of your spells.
    <br>When you cast an astromancer spell that has a range other than touch, you can cast the spell as if it were originating from a space you can see within 10 feet of you.
    <br><br> At 15th level your displacement range increases to 20 feet and you can move the center of your Astronomical Aura anywhere you can see within the same range at the start of each of your turns while it is active or as part of the bonus action
    used to summon it.
